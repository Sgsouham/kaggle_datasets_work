Some of the most common ML tasks which help building the basic concepts.
Will contain a series of ML notebooks carrying out the easiest of Projects.
A beginners guide and can also be considered as a roadMap.
1) Fraud Detection- Working on imbalanced dataset is a challenge. A classical classification problem. The dataset used already had columns that were dimensionally reduced and thus have no specific names. But the time and amount column were not normalised.
2) Ham or Spam - A simple NLP project to do a binary classification on text. Main take aways from the project would be to understand the basic pipeline of a NLP project.
3) Fake news or real news- Another simple NLP project to do a binary classification on text. The main motive behind this project was to see how well an LSTM model works on a Text dataset.
